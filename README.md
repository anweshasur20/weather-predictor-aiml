# weather-predictor-aiml
This project is a web-based Weather Forecasting App developed using Django and integrated with AI/ML models to predict future weather conditions based on historical weather data. It features an interactive interface where users can input queries and receive forecast results.

The core machine learning model is built using Python (e.g., RNN for time-series forecasting), and predictions are served through a custom-built Django REST API. This allows for clean separation between the frontend and backend, and makes the system more scalable and flexible for future integrations (like mobile apps or external platforms).
